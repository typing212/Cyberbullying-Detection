# Cyberbullying-Detection
Cyberbullying, defined as the intentional use of digital technology to cause harm (Englander et al., 2017), is a serious problem that must be addressed. This project aims to investigate the use of advanced machine learning models to solve the classification problem. Furthermore, it may be worthwhile to investigate data augmentation techniques to generate more text data in order to better understand the impact of having more data on deep learning model performance. Classification models were built separately for the text and image data.


## Techniques
Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naive-Bayes (NB), long short term memory (LSTM), Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), RoBERTa, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
